# Status of non-CASE, non-UCO vocabulary usage

This directory contains text files that list terms not known to CASE or UCO, but used in CASE-Corpora.  The lists exclude all terms found to be in the CASE and imported UCO ontology version provided by the [pinned version](https://github.com/casework/CASE-Examples/blob/master/requirements.txt) of [`case-utils`](https://pypi.org/project/case-utils/).  The lists also exclude all "Knowledge-base" graph nodes, which represent instance data.

The following table is the count of undefined concepts used in each example file:

```
59 undefined_concepts.txt
```

The following table is the count of undefined relationship literals used in each example file:

```
2 undefined_kindOfRelationships.tsv
```
