# Status of non-CASE, non-UCO vocabulary usage

This directory contains text files that list terms not known to CASE or UCO, but used in the [Hardware Duplicator JSON-LD illustration](https://caseontology.org/examples/hardwdare_duplicator/).  The lists exclude all terms found to be in the CASE and UCO ontology versions tracked as Git submodules of this repository.  The lists also exclude all "Knowledge-base" graph nodes, which represent instance data.

The following table is the count of unknown terms yet used in each example file:

```
15 undefined_concepts.txt
```

The following table is the count of unknown relationship literals used in each example file:
